Hello!
An easy way to send SMS from command line!
I've used way2sms as a bridge to send SMS, just download the script and replace the MYNUM and PASS with your way2sms registered mobile number and it's password.
After that just execute the script as

`./sms`

Execute as

`./sms -m`

to send SMS to your mobile itself!

BTW, use control + d for ending the stdin or pipe it from a file

I successfully removed way2sms signature in the delivered SMS by appending whitespaces.

further updates are coming :p
